# 👽 Rick & Morty Character App 👽

Final project of Adalab Front-Dev Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment is to develop an SPA using React ⚛️ that allows the user to search in a list of characters (currently working on showing the full cast ⚠️🔧), and see some info as their status, species or how many episodes they've been into.

## Languages used

Kept it short and sweet:

- React
- Javascript
- CSS3

## Structure

Also short and sweet:

- Landing page with CSS animated background and gifs, cause we **do** love our gifs.
- Main page where everything else is rendered: a lovely header with a cool logo, a random quote title which will re-load everytime you update the page - I know, cool -, the search tool with filters and reset button, and finally, the character search.
